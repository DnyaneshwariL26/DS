Boston Housing Dataset & Linear Regression Model
The Boston Housing Dataset is a well-known dataset used for regression analysis. It contains 506 samples with 14 feature variables, including factors like crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways. The goal is to predict house prices based on these features.

Linear Regression Model for Prediction
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (house price) and one or more independent variables (features like crime rate, number of rooms, etc.).

Steps to Build the Model in Python
Load the Dataset

Use pandas to read the dataset.

Explore the dataset using df.head() and df.describe().

Preprocess the Data

Handle missing values.

Normalize or scale features if necessary.

Split Data into Training & Testing Sets

Use train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.

Train the Linear Regression Model

Use LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model.

Evaluate the Model

Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
