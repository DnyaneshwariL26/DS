Data Wrangling II refers to the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a structured format for analysis. It is a continuation of Data Wrangling I, focusing on deeper data preprocessing techniques.

. Handling Missing Values and Inconsistencies
Data often contains missing values and inconsistencies due to errors in collection or recording. Here are common techniques to handle them:

Deletion: If missing values are minimal, rows or columns can be removed.

Imputation: Filling missing values using mean, median, mode, or predictive techniques like regression and KNN imputation.

Forward or Backward Fill: Using previous or next values to fill missing data.

Custom Handling: Identifying inconsistencies and using logical replacements.

2. Identifying and Treating Outliers
Outliers are extreme values that can distort analysis. Methods to detect and handle outliers include:

Visualization: Box plots, histograms, and scatter plots help in detecting outliers.

Statistical Methods: Using Z-scores or the Interquartile Range (IQR) to identify anomalies.

Winsorizing: Transforming outliers to near-boundary values.

Capping: Setting upper and lower bounds for values.

Removing Outliers: If an outlier is due to an error, it can be removed.
